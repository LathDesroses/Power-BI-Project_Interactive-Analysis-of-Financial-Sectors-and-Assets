## Overview
This project, titled **"Interactive Analysis of Financial Sectors and Assets: Exploring with Power BI"**, is a comprehensive study of financial sectors and assets. It leverages data analysis and visualization to provide actionable insights into sector trends, asset performance, and inter-sector relationships

The project focuses on three main perspectives:
1. **Global Sector Overview**
2. **Intra-Sector Analysis**
3. **Detailed Asset View**

---

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
- **Visualizing Sector Trends**: Identify dominant sectors by volume and performance
- **Comparing Key Indicators**: Facilitate optimized portfolio diversification through advanced financial metrics
- **Supporting Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide actionable insights using comprehensive visualizations

---

## Data Collection
### Source
Data was scraped from **Yahoo Finance** using Selenium WebDriver. The dataset includes:
- **50 financial assets**, grouped into **10 sectors**
- Daily trading data over **250 days**, with fields: `Ticker`, `Sector`, `Date`, `Open`, `Low`, `High`, `Close`, `Adjusted Close`

### Tools Used
- **Selenium** for web scraping, utilizing XPath selectors
- **Python** libraries for data processing and indicator calculations

---

## Data Processing
### Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured consistency
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Variable distribution
   - Price trends
   - Correlations between variables
   - Volatility heatmaps (by sector and month)
3. **Indicator Calculation**: Computed 13 key financial indicators, including:
   - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, VWAP
   - Daily Return, Volatility, SMA, EMA

### Output
Processed data was saved in an Excel file with two sheets:
- `data`: Asset-level data with calculated indicators
- `sector_correlation`: Correlation matrix between sectors

---

## Visualization
### Tool
**Power BI** was used to create interactive dashboards, divided into three main sections:

#### Page 1: Global Sector Comparison
- **Treemap**: Visualizes trading volumes by sector. Highlights technology as the dominant sector, led by NVIDIA
- **Combined Chart**: Compares average returns and volatility across sectors
- **Heatmap**: Shows inter-sector correlations for diversification strategies
- **Bar Chart**: Highlights long-term performance leaders like utilities, real estate, and finance

#### Page 2: Intra-Sector Analysis
- **Combined Chart**: Displays adjusted prices with Bollinger Bands to detect overbought/oversold conditions
- **VWAP Comparison**: Shows demand and selling pressure trends
- **Box Plot**: Analyzes daily returns within sectors, showing dispersion and opportunities
- **Performance Table**: Summarizes key indicators like RSI and daily returns
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Visualizes trading volumes by asset within each sector

#### Page 3: Detailed Asset View
- **RSI Analysis**: Highlights potential corrections using RSI thresholds
- **MACD and Signal Line**: Provides buy/sell signals based on crossovers
- **Radar Chart**: Showcases strengths and risks of specific assets
- **Asset Performance Table**: Identifies assets with high volatility or significant price trends
- **Scatter Plot**: Explores relationships between VWAP and Bollinger Bands
